> **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) Solver**  
> Like a kangaroo, but with math, speed, and *emotional damage*.

## üí° What is this?

Welcome to **KANGAROO**, the only crypto-animal you‚Äôll ever need. This isn‚Äôt just a Python script‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-on *mathematical kangaroo simulator* for solving the ECDLP. Why is it a kangaroo? Because kangaroos **hop**. This one hops through elliptic curve land trying to guess your secrets.

You give it a compressed SECP256k1 public key, and it returns your private key.  
Simple. Dangerous. Ridiculous.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

> üí£ **This code is strictly for educational and research purposes only.**  
> Do not use it on anything you do not own.  
> If you try it on the wrong thing, the crypto gods will find you and SHA256 your soul.

## üß™ Features

- üöÄ **Parallel brute force with multiprocessing**  
- üî• **Random seed generation** for kangaroo variety  
- üêë **Tame and wild herds** of hopping point trackers  
- üßÆ Full-blown ECC arithmetic with `gmpy2` (because math is hard)  
- üìù Automatically logs keys like it‚Äôs 1999  
- üïµÔ∏è Finds private keys (sometimes) with more drama than a Netflix docuseries  

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- üêç Python 3.8+
- üßÆ `gmpy2`
- üß† Brain cells (optional, but helpful)

```bash
pip install gmpy2
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

```bash
python kangaroo.py
```

Then sit back and watch it bounce like an over-caffeinated marsupial.

---

## üß† How it Works (sort of)

- Generates **herds** of elliptic curve points.
- Makes them **hop** around like lost tourists.
- Waits for two of them to crash into each other.
- Derives a private key from the wreckage.
- Profit??? No.

---

## üéØ Target

Cracking private keys of SECP256k1 compressed public keys in up to 40-bit space.  
More than that? Bring snacks. And a few millennia.

## üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why the name?

Because **Pollard's Kangaroo algorithm** is real, and because who doesn‚Äôt love a script where kangaroos break crypto?
